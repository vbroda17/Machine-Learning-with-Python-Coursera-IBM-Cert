1. Logistic regression's primary purpose is to classify based on predicted probablility of an observation belonging to two classes

2. The kind of outcomes it predicts is binary classification

3. Threshold probablility is the parameter used to determine the class of an observation.

4. Minimizing the cost function (log loss) is the primary objective in the training Processes

5. The first think to do after evaluating the model and noticing a high log loss is parameter tuning.
