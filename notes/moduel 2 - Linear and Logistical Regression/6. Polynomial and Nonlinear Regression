Intro to polynomial and nonlinear regression

Nonlinear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a variable and one or more independent variables where the relationship is represented by a non linear equation.

This could be polynomial, eponential, logarithmic, or any other function that does not use linear parameters.

Nonlinear regression is useful when there is a complex relationship between variables that cannot be captured through a straight line.
Data relationship is rearly linear. More often the trend is that of a smoothed curve

Polynomial regression an ordinary linear regression to indirectly fit data to polynomial expressions.
Nonlinear regression follows the same idea, but bases its inputs on functions of given features, such as logarithm or exponential of the features.
Nonlinear also does not necessarily reduce to linear regression like polynoial regression does. 

Pick regressor that fits trend, not every fine detail.

Polynomial regression expresses a nonlinear depencence on the input features, but it has a linear dependence on the regression coefficeients becasue it can be transformed into a linear regression poroblem.
Often simply called linear regressions.
In constast, maby real world complex nonlinear relationsips that can't be modeled as polynomials. For example, exponential or compound growth. (inventsments). Also logmarithmics

Many ways to determin the kind of model to use. 
Look at it visually to  see if linear or non linear
Generate the model and analyze the results.

How to find an optimal nonlinear model.
If there is a mathematical expression for the model, can use optimization technique like gradient descent to find optimal parameters. 
Otherwise if no specific regression model you can just select any of the meachine learning models: (optimizing non linear models) like regeression trees, random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, gradient boosting machines, k-nearest neighbors.
Nonlinear regression use polynomial, exponential, logarithmic equeations to model data.
