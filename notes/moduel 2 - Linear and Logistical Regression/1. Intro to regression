Linear regression

Models a relationshiip between a continyous target variable and explanatory features.

There are several types of regression models (goin over simple and mulltiple)
Deciding on the one to use depends on the data for the dependent variable and the type of model that has the best fit

Simple Regression - a single independent variable estimated a dependent variable.
Can be linear or nonlinear
Imposes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent varriable
Non linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables

Multiple Regression - when more than one independent variable is present
Same distinctions between linear and nonlinear relationships

Some algorithms
Linear and polynomial are classical statistical modeling methods
Random forest and XGBoost are modern machine learning regression models
Others inclusde k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks
