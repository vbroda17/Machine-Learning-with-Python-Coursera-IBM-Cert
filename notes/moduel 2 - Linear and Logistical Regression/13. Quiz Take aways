1. Simple regression is when you have two variable, and proabably have a linear relationship
2. Multiple Linear regression is when you have more than 2 variables, probably want to predict something, and the features are very likely to be linearly related to each other.
For this think home prices basses on size, beds, locations, etc.
3. Polynomial regression is more for smoother curves. Anything non-linear like exponential, logarithmic, and so on falls into this. 
4. Logarithmic regression is best for situations with diminishing returns, or when you want to do binary type of analysises or classifications. 
Think we have these two options, what causes it to be one or the other.
5. Logistic regresion may need to tune the decision threshold if you see it often misclassifies a certain type of input.
6. Logistic regression predicts the chance of something is .4, then there's a 40% chance it happens, according to the prediction.
7. Log loss increases when the model is confidently wrong, which is heavily penalized.
