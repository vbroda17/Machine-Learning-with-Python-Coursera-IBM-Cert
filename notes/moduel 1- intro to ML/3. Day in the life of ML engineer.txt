Going through more detailed of last notes

1. Problem Definition.
This part is very important because you need to make sure the ML solution allines with the needs

2. Data Collection.
identify what data is avaliable on hand (sush as user, production, or other general data)
Take this data and transform it. In the end you want to make sure that it is all in one sources

3. Data preperation
This part overlaps with the data collection
Data offten has errors, missing data, different formats and such. 
So try to prepare a somewhat final version of the data
- remove data to remove irrelevant data
- remove extreme values
- remove or randomly generate missing values
- each data colum are the proper formats
- create new features
- Do some exploratory data analysis
- Identify how to split up the data into training and test sets (random or most recent for test)

4. Model Development
Explore existing frameworks (leverage these as much as possible)
Example is Content based filtering and collaborative filtering (Example in the video)

5. Model Evaluation
Tuning the models
Evaluating the model data that was not in the training
Later futher evaluate with some real users and obtaining feedback
 - metrics from this depend on what is going on

6. Model Deployment
Once satisfied Deployment
Keep an eye on the model and make sure it is working well
Update the model with new data in the future
