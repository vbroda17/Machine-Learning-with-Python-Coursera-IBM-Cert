AI makes computers look intelegent by simulating cognative abilites (of humans).
AI is a general feild including:
Computer vision
NLP
generative AIml
deep learning

ML using algorithms and feature engineering
Deep learning uses layered networks and automatically extracts features from data
ML teached coputers, identify patterns and amke decisions
algorithms do stuff without a fixed algorithms

Supervised learning models trained on labeled data
Unsupervised learning models work withou lables
Semi Supervise learning is iterative
Reinforcement learning works with feedback from envirionment

ML techniques:
Classification to predict a category
regression esitmates and predicts continuous values
clustering groups together
association feild to find items or events that offten occur together
anomoly detection to find unsuual cases
Sequence mining is used to predict the next event
Classification reduction is used to reduce data size, particularly the number of features needed
recomendation systems, associate peoples tastes together

ML on lables data, use classification or regression
CLass prediction on a groups
regression does a continuous value

Computer vision with how ML works
Its great instead of trying to make a lot of very specific rules
